                <h1>Joni Hendrickson's Microsite</h1>
                <p>Microsite is a blog hosted entirely on an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, demonstrating how modern web
                    design can thrive even on severely resource-constrained hardware. This project explores how much
                    functionality can be squeezed out of a small microcontroller, using innovative techniques to serve
                    web content efficiently and reliably.</p>
                <!-- TODO: IMAGE_OF_MCU -->

                <h2>Testing CSS Rules</h2>

                <p>
                    The paragraph element (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) is one of the most fundamental HTML elements, used to
                    group blocks of text into readable sections.
                    Paragraphs are widely used in articles, blogs, and other web content to provide structure and
                    improve readability.
                    A well-written paragraph conveys a single idea or topic in a clear and concise manner, typically
                    separated by whitespace to ensure visual clarity.
                </p>

                <h3>Text Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    This paragraph demonstrates <em>emphasized text</em>, often used to draw attention to specific words
                    or phrases.
                    Emphasis is commonly applied in instructional content or persuasive writing.
                    Similarly, <strong>strong text</strong> is used to indicate importance or urgency, such as warnings
                    or critical points.
                    Inline code like <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> is helpful for showing
                    examples of code within paragraphs.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    Blockquote elements are used to indicate quotations or excerpts from other sources.
                    They help to visually distinguish cited text from the surrounding content, which is particularly
                    useful in academic or editorial writing.
                </blockquote>

                <!-- <pre><code>// Preformatted text and code blocks are crucial for displaying code snippets
            function exampleFunction() {
                console.log('This is a test of a preformatted code block.');
            }</code></pre> -->

                <h3>Footnotes</h3>
                <p>
                    Footnotes are used to provide additional information or references without disrupting the main
                    content.<sup id="ref1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>
                    Here’s an example of a sentence with a footnote.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>
                </p>

                <h3>Lists</h3>
                <p>
                    Lists are an essential part of organizing information on the web.
                    Unordered lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) present items without a specific order, commonly used for
                    bullet points:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unordered lists are simple and effective.</li>
                    <li>They help to break down information into digestible pieces.</li>
                    <li>Each item is displayed as a separate bullet point.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Ordered lists (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>) are similar but imply a sequence or ranking:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First item in the sequence.</li>
                    <li>Second item in the sequence.</li>
                    <li>Third item in the sequence.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Links</h3>
                <p>
                    Links (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) are the backbone of the web, enabling navigation between pages or
                    external resources.
                    <a href="https://example.com">This is a regular link</a> pointing to an external site.
                    For convenience, you can also open links in a new tab, like this:
                    <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">link opening in a new tab</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Image and Caption</h3>
                <p>
                    Images are vital for enhancing visual content on websites. They can be standalone or paired with
                    captions for context.
                    Below is an example of an image with a caption:
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="<!-- {{IMAGE:food/burger.webp}} -->" alt="A delicious burger">
                    <figcaption>This is an example of an image caption, providing additional context for the image
                        above.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Table</h3>
                <p>
                    Tables are a structured way of presenting data, often used for comparison, statistics, or other
                    tabular information.
                    Here’s a simple example:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Feature</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                            <th>Example</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Unordered List</td>
                            <td>A list where items have no specific order.</td>
                            <td>&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Ordered List</td>
                            <td>A list where items are ranked or sequential.</td>
                            <td>&lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt;</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Table</td>
                            <td>A way to present structured data.</td>
                            <td>&lt;table&gt;...&lt;/table&gt;</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
