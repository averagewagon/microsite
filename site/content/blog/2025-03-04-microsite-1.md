This post is my build log for the Microsite itself, which is hosted on an ~8 USD
microcontroller. I'll cover the basics of web servers, and show how I
implemented one with extreme resource constraints.

Web servers are computers which, when you ask them nicely, send you some
information. At the high end, web servers might be entire fleets of rack-mounted
computers, located in different countries and costing millions upon millions of
dollars. At the low end, a web server might be a single Raspberry Pi in
somebody's apartment.

The blog you're currently reading is hosted on an ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N32R8V,
with far less memory and computing power than any desktop-grade computer. Even a
Raspberry Pi 5, a common lower-end computer, is much more powerful than this
particular development board.

Despite the resource constraints, the microcontroller does an adequate job of
delivering this website to your computer, phone, or smart fridge[^1]. A web
server with these specs won't be serving millions of visitors, but I'd imagine
that the vast majority of websites will never see the kind of traffic which
would require a more powerful computer.

## What's in a web server?

A web server is a computer connected to the internet, usually available through
a domain. When your web browser loads a modern webpage, it sends an HTTPS
request to the web server hosting that page. The server then processes this
request and sends back the necessary files, such as HTML, CSS, and images[^2],
which your browser uses to display the webpage on your screen.
