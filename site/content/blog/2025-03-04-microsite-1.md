- A short introduction, explaining to the audience what the article will be
  about.
- What is handled by the ESP IDF HTTP server?
  - Setting up TLS sessions/doing the exchange
  - TCP session management, keep-alives, listening on a socket
  - Doing the initial parsing/copying when an HTTP request is incoming
  - Invoking a callback in my code for me to do the rest
  - Providing helpers for me to construct and send a response
  - Make a labeled block diagram?
- What did I have to build
  - Everything on top of that single callback
  - First, just sending a fixed payload defined in a static string
  - Then, integrating LittleFS to pull from a file system based on paths
    requested by site visitors
    - Include MIME type handling
  - Creating a shell script which generates littlefs images from a folder in my
    repo, and copies it into the flash storage of the site
  - Putting a simple static site of HTML/CSS into that folder and watching it
    get served from the device. That's a website!
- Making it public
  - Registering a domain name on Namecheap
  - Pinning my device IP on my shitty Google Nest WiFi router, through the Home
    app and port forwarding 443
  - Associating my IPV4 address of my router with my domain name
  - Connecting via HTTP over the public internet!
- Making it HTTPS
  - Using LetsEncrypt to generate some keys and certs
  - Installing those keys/certs into flash memory using ESP IDF, and setting up
    their mbedtls to use them
  - Enabling the HTTPS server in ESP IDF
  - Problems: will have to manually rotate the LetsEncrypt stuff, but oh well!
- At that point, I had a technically functioning website.
  - Very slow - running on an ESP32 with WiFi, no crypto accelerators
  - (benchmark) x seconds to connect for the first time
  - Limited by the 240kb of memory on my esp32
  - Limited by the xkb of flash storage on the esp32
  - Screenshot of the website
  - Picture of the ESP32 sitting on a table
- Next steps
  - Create an actual website to host on it
  - Upgrade the firmware to get some better performance
