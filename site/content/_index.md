Welcome to the **Microsite**, my personal website and blog which is served from
a single ESP32-S3 in my studio apartment up in Seattle, Washington. For more
details, check out the ["About the
Microsite"]({{< ref "about-the-microsite.md" >}}) page.

I'm **Joni Hendrickson**, an embedded systems engineer doing things with
microcontrollers, robotics, and websites. I've worked on satellites, grocery
stores, virtual reality, FreeRTOS, and some other things. I made this website so
that I could get better at writing, and so that I could talk about the things I
make.

## What am I working on?

I've just about finished with my first version of the Microsite, running on an
ESP32-S3 devkit and ESP-IDF, and I'm cutting myself off to work on writing up
some blog posts.

Afterwards, there's a few things I may work on:

- Making "Checkerbot" -- a small gantry robot which plays checkers
- Porting the Microsite to the Zephyr RTOS
- Designing some custom hardware for the Microsite
