Microsite is a static website hosted on an ESP32 microcontroller. The project
explores hosting a functional website on hardware with limited resources.

The website is live at **[averagewagon.dev](https://averagewagon.dev)** and
focuses on:

- Hosting an HTTPS website using an ESP32.
- Serving static content efficiently in a constrained environment.
- Using the Zola static site generator to build and organize content.
- Experimenting with hardware features like custom PCBs and additional storage.

This blog provides updates and technical details about the project's development
and progress.
